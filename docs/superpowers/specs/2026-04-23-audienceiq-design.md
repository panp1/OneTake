# AudienceIQ — Recruitment Audience Intelligence System

## Overview

AudienceIQ is a four-ring audience drift detection engine that answers: **"What is the gap between who we're targeting, who we're reaching, and who actually becomes a quality contributor?"**

It fuses five data sources — UTM click tracking (built), CRM contributor datalake, GA4/GTM/GSC analytics, HIE behavioral heatmaps (ported from VYRA), and ad platform audience reports — into a unified intelligence layer that no competitor can replicate.

**Core differentiator:** OneForma's CRM contains contributor quality scores, skills, activity status, and retention data. Connecting this to ad attribution creates a closed-loop feedback system that measures cost-per-quality-contributor, not just cost-per-click.

---

## The Four-Ring Drift Model

AudienceIQ computes drift across four audience rings for every campaign:

### Ring 1 — Declared ICP (Who We WANT)
**Source:** `intake_requests` persona data + `campaign_strategies` + ad platform targeting configs
**Data:** Demographics, languages, regions, skills, experience level, engagement model, job requirements

### Ring 2 — Paid Audience (Who We're PAYING to Reach)
**Source:** Google Ads API, Meta Ads API, LinkedIn Campaign Manager, TikTok Ads API
**Data:** Audience targeting settings, demographic breakdowns, interest segments, lookalike sources

### Ring 3 — Observed Audience (Who We're Actually REACHING)
**Source:** GA4 sessions + HIE behavioral signals + UTM click profiles
**Data:** Actual visitor demographics, device/geo/language, behavior patterns, scroll depth, engagement quality, form interaction

### Ring 4 — Converted Audience (Who We're CLOSING — Ground Truth)
**Source:** CRM Postgres datalake — contributor profiles matched to campaign via UTM passthrough
**Data:** Signup source, skills verified, quality scores, activity status, retention, earnings, project history

### Drift Calculation (adapted from VYRA's three-way model)

```
Overall Drift = (
  declared_vs_paid     x 0.25    // Are ads targeting right people?
  declared_vs_organic  x 0.20    // Are the right people finding us organically?
  paid_vs_converted    x 0.30    // Are we CLOSING who we're paying for? (highest weight)
  organic_vs_converted x 0.25    // Does organic attract quality contributors?
)
```

`paid_vs_converted` gets the highest weight because it directly measures ad spend waste.

**Drift severity thresholds** (from VYRA):
- <= 15%: LOW (healthy — targeting is aligned)
- 15-25%: MODERATE (optimization needed)
- > 25%: HIGH (significant mismatch — budget reallocation required)

**Segment mismatch triggered:** When `overall_drift > 15.0`

---

## Identity Stitching & Cross-Device Tracking

### UTM Passthrough (Signup → CRM)
The OneForma signup flow passes UTM parameters through to the CRM record. This means every CRM contributor can be traced back to the campaign, source, medium, and creative that brought them in.

Match chain: `tracked_link.slug` → `/r/[slug]` redirect → `destination_url?utm_*` → signup form → CRM record with `referral_source` / UTM fields.

### Anonymous-to-Known Identity Resolution
Three-stage identity stitching:

1. **Anonymous:** HIE assigns `vyra_vid` (visitor cookie) + `vyra_hsid` (session cookie). GA4 assigns `client_id`. UTM click assigns `tracked_link.slug`.
2. **Pseudonymous:** When visitor submits a form or engages with a CTA, HIE captures the form interaction event (no field values — just field types and completion). GA4 fires a conversion event.
3. **Known:** On CRM signup, the UTM params link the anonymous visitor chain to a real contributor profile. The `client_id` / `visitor_id` is associated with the CRM `user_id` / `email`.

Cross-device: Once the email is known from CRM signup, all sessions with that email (across devices) are stitched into one journey. This is stored in a `visitor_identities` mapping table.

## Data Architecture

### Five Data Sources

| Source | Type | Connection | Latency |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| **UTM Tracking** | First-party, built | Same Neon DB (`tracked_links`) | Real-time |
| **CRM Datalake** | First-party, existing | Read-only Postgres connection (separate instance) | Near-real-time (sync job) |
| **GA4** | Google API | Analytics MCP server (configured) + GA4 Data API | Hourly/daily |
| **HIE** | First-party, ported | Neon DB (new tables) + client-side JS via GTM | Real-time ingest, daily aggregation |
| **Ad Platforms** | Third-party APIs | Google Ads API, Meta Marketing API | Daily sync |

### CRM Datalake Connection (Env-Var Gated)

The CRM integration is built **fully wired but behind an env var gate**. Everything — sync service, cache tables, identity stitching, widgets, drift computation — works with empty/mock data until the connection is configured. Once `CRM_DATABASE_URL` is set, it lights up automatically.

**Env vars required (not yet available — built ready to plug in):**
```
CRM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://readonly:***@crm-host:5432/oneforma_crm
CRM_SYNC_ENABLED=true
CRM_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
```

**Connection behavior:**
- `CRM_DATABASE_URL` unset → all CRM-dependent widgets show "CRM not connected" state with setup instructions, drift calculations skip Ring 4, health scoring skips CRM detectors
- `CRM_DATABASE_URL` set → **read-only** connection to the OneForma CRM Postgres instance
- **Sync job** runs every `CRM_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 15), pulling new/updated contributor profiles into `crm_sync_cache`
- Matching: `crm_sync_cache.utm_campaign` → `tracked_links.utm_campaign` AND/OR `crm_sync_cache.email` → `visitor_identities.email`
- **Never writes to the CRM** — only reads
- Connection uses a **separate Postgres client** (not the Neon `getDb()` pool) to isolate CRM queries from app DB queries
- If CRM connection fails, graceful degradation: widgets show "CRM sync error" but app continues functioning

### GA4 Integration

- **Analytics MCP server** already configured in toolchain (`mcp__analytics-mcp__run_report`, `mcp__analytics-mcp__run_realtime_report`)
- **Daily sync job** pulls session data, demographics, traffic sources into `ga4_session_cache`
- **Real-time widget** can call MCP directly for live session counts
- **GSC integration** for search query data (which searches lead to OneForma pages)

## HIE Port (from VYRA)

### What Gets Ported

| VYRA Component | Lines | Adaptation |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| `vyra-tracking-hie.js` (client script) | 741 | Rename cookies, change endpoint URLs, deploy via GTM |
| Event ingest routes | 311 | Next.js API routes instead of FastAPI |
| Session/event DB models | 300 | Neon tables (simplified — unified `hie_events` instead of 3 tables) |
| Fact materialization service | 500 | Cron job or scheduled API route |
| Query service | 200 | Next.js API routes |
| Diagnostics service | 600 | Port detectors (scroll cliff, CTA weakness, form friction) |
| Frontend: HIEHeatmap, HIEScrollmap, HIEReplay | 1000+ | Port as Insights widgets (light theme) |

### What Gets Simplified

- **Keep VYRA's separated table architecture** — `hie_interaction_events`, `hie_scroll_events`, `hie_page_snapshots` as distinct tables. OneForma has 1M+ monthly visitors and growing — a single unified event table would choke at that volume. Fact materialization tables (`hie_heat_facts`, `hie_scroll_facts`) are required for performant heatmap queries.
- **No separate snapshot service initially** — DOM snapshots deferred to Phase 3
- **Fact materialization via cron** instead of dedicated scheduler service
- **5 diagnostics detectors** instead of VYRA's full set (scroll_cliff, cta_weakness, form_friction, platform_mismatch, ignored_section)

### HIE Deployment via GTM

The HIE client script is injected on OneForma landing pages via Google Tag Manager:
1. Upload `nova-tracking-hie.js` to Vercel Blob (or serve from `/api/hie/script.js`)
2. Create GTM Custom HTML tag that loads the script
3. Configure trigger: fire on all OneForma landing pages
4. Script sends events to `POST /api/hie/batch` with API key auth

## Recruitment-Adapted Health Scoring

Starts at 100, deducts for issues:

| Detector | Description | Deduction | Source |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `quality_drift` | Signup volume high but avg quality score declining | -30 | CRM |
| `retention_drift` | Campaign produces signups who churn within 30 days | -25 | CRM |
| `skill_mismatch` | Targeting "ML engineers" but closing "data entry" profiles | -25 | CRM vs Declared |
| `geo_mismatch` | Ads target Morocco but quality contributors come from Egypt | -20 | CRM vs Paid |
| `demographic_mismatch` | Age/experience profile doesn't match targeting | -15 | CRM vs Declared |
| `cpa_burnout` | Cost per acquisition rising >25% over 7 days | -20 | Ad Platforms |
| `ctr_decay` | Click-through rate declining >20% over 7 days | -15 | Ad Platforms |
| `scroll_cliff` | >30% drop at a scroll milestone on landing page | -15 | HIE |
| `cta_weakness` | High hover/attention but low click rate on CTA | -15 | HIE |
| `form_friction` | High form abandonment rate | -20 | HIE |
| `lp_mismatch` | Good CTR but low conversion — landing page problem | -20 | GA4 + HIE |

---

## Build Phases

### Phase 1: CRM Connection + Attribution Funnel (Ship First)
**Why first:** Highest value, lowest risk. CRM data exists NOW. No scripts to deploy, no data accumulation wait.

- Read-only Postgres connection to CRM datalake
- `crm_sync_cache` table + 15-minute sync job
- `visitor_identities` table for UTM → CRM matching
- Contributor Funnel widget (clicks → signups → active → quality)
- Quality by Channel widget
- Retention Curve widget
- Skill Distribution widget (declared vs actual)
- Targeting vs Reality widget
- Add "AudienceIQ" widget category to Insights dashboard registry

### Phase 2: Drift Engine + Health Scoring
**Why second:** Builds on CRM data to compute the core drift metrics.

- `audience_profiles` table — build profiles from each ring
- Profile builders: declared (from intake form), converted (from CRM cache)
- `audience_drift_snapshots` table + drift calculator (adapted from VYRA's `detect_drift()`)
- `audience_health_scores` table + health scorer (adapted from VYRA's `score_audience_health()`)
- Drift Radar widget (four-ring visualization)
- Audience Health widget (gauge + issues)
- Drift computation cron (daily, or on-demand per campaign)

### Phase 3: GA4 + GSC Integration
**Why third:** Enriches the "observed" ring with real analytics data.

- GA4 Data API integration via analytics MCP server
- `ga4_session_cache` table + daily sync
- GSC search query data pull
- GA4 Traffic widget
- GSC Queries widget
- Enhanced drift: GA4 demographics feed into Ring 3 (observed audience)

### Phase 4: HIE Behavioral Layer
**Why fourth:** Requires deploying tracking script, waiting for data accumulation.

- Port `nova-tracking-hie.js` client script (adapted from VYRA's 741-line HIE script)
- Deploy via GTM on OneForma landing pages
- HIE ingest API routes (`/api/hie/session`, `/api/hie/batch`)
- `hie_sessions`, `hie_events`, `hie_heat_facts`, `hie_scroll_facts` tables
- Fact materialization cron
- HIE Heatmap widget, HIE Scrollmap widget, HIE Form Friction widget
- Diagnostics: scroll_cliff, cta_weakness, form_friction, lp_mismatch
- Feed HIE behavioral signals into Ring 3 (observed audience)

### Phase 5: Ad Platform Audiences + Full Loop
**Why last:** Requires API credentials for each ad platform. Completes Ring 2.

- Google Ads API integration (audience reports, demographic breakdowns)
- Meta Marketing API (audience insights)
- LinkedIn Campaign Manager API (engagement data)
- Platform audience sync into `audience_profiles` (Ring 2)
- Full four-ring drift with all data sources flowing
- Budget reallocation recommendations based on CRM-verified ROI

## Privacy & Compliance

- **CRM connection is read-only** — never writes to the contributor datalake
- **HIE consent gate** — respects `window.nova.hieConsent === false`
- **No form field values captured** by HIE — only field types, completion status, timing
- **PII handling:** email used only for identity stitching, stored hashed in `visitor_identities`
- **GDPR right-to-forget:** DELETE endpoint purges all behavioral + identity data for a visitor
- **Cross-device tracking is opt-in** — only stitches when user explicitly provides email via signup
- **Data retention:** HIE raw events purged after 90 days, fact tables retained indefinitely
- **CRM cache TTL:** 24 hours — stale records refreshed on next sync cycle

---

## Success Metrics

After 30 days of Phase 1+2 deployment:

- Can answer: "Which campaign produces the highest quality contributors?"
- Can identify: drift between declared ICP and actual converter profile
- Can recommend: budget reallocation based on CRM-verified cost-per-quality-contributor
- Can detect: campaigns producing high signup volume but low quality/retention (vanity metrics)

After full deployment (all 5 phases):

- Four-ring drift score computed daily for every active campaign
- Health score with actionable issue detection (quality drift, retention drift, skill mismatch)
- HIE behavioral evidence on landing pages (scroll cliffs, CTA weakness, form friction)
- GA4-enriched traffic attribution with cross-device identity stitching
- Full-funnel visibility: ad impression → click → page visit → behavior → signup → active contributor → quality score
