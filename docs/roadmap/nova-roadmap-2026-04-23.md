## What's Live (Shipped)

### Core Pipeline (6 Stages)
| Stage | Name | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Strategic Intelligence | Live | Cultural research, personas, campaign strategy, interest graph routing |
| 2 | Image Generation | Live | NIM (Seedream), VQA validation, actor identity cards |
| 3 | Copy Generation | Live | Per-persona x channel x language, brand voice, cultural adaptation |
| 4 | Composition Engine | Live | HTML template rendering via GLM-5, VQA gate |
| 5 | Video Pipeline | Partial | Kling API integration built, credits being loaded |
| 6 | Landing Pages | Partial | Template system built, design polish in progress |

### Four Portals
| Portal | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Recruiter | Intake form, creative library, UTM link builder | Live |
| Marketing Manager | Command center, campaign workspace, insights dashboard | Live |
| Designer | Gallery, edit suite, Figma integration | Live |
| Agency | Magic-link handoff, ad set targeting, budget allocation | Live |

### Unified Campaign Workspace (NEW — April 23)
- **Country bar** — primary navigation with per-country status badges (DONE/GEN/PEND)
- **All Countries overview** — grid of country cards with status filters + aggregate stats
- **Section pills** — Brief / Personas / Creatives / Media Strategy / Channel Mix / Videos / Cultural Research
- **Client-side filtering** — `useMemo` filters actors/assets/strategies by country, instant switching
- **Persona scaling** — 2 personas x 2 actors (1-2 countries), 1 x 1 (3+ countries)
- **Country job creator** — replaces campaign splitter. One campaign, many compute_jobs.
- **93 tests** (46 Python + 47 TypeScript)

### GraphRAG Platform Interest Routing (NEW — April 23)
- **Knowledge graph**: 1,054 interest nodes across 6 platforms (Meta 312, LinkedIn 274, TikTok 130, Reddit 118, Snapchat 84, WeChat 141)
- **1,018 edges**: 740 hierarchy (parent_of) + 278 cross-platform (equivalent_on)
- **Interest router**: Maps LLM concepts to real platform interests → `{hyper[], hot[], broad[]}`
- **Cross-platform intelligence**: Traverses `equivalent_on` edges for consistent targeting
- **Stage 1 integration**: Post-processes strategy output, non-fatal fallback
- **Frontend fixes**: AdSetRow simplified, MediaStrategyEditor null safety
- **29 tests** (13 seeder integrity + 16 router logic)

### AudienceIQ Intelligence Layer (NEW — April 23)
Four-ring audience drift detection: "What is the gap between who we target, who we reach, and who converts?"

| Phase | Name | Status | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CRM Integration | Shipped | Identity stitching (UTM → CRM), contributor funnel, quality-by-channel, retention curves, skill distribution |
| 2 | Drift Engine | Shipped | Four-ring drift calculation (declared vs paid vs organic vs converted), 100-point health scoring, issue detection |
| 3 | GA4 + GSC | Shipped | Session caching, traffic sources, device breakdown, search query analysis, organic profile building |
| 4 | HIE Behavioral | Planned | VYRA tracking script port, scroll depth, CTA clicks, form friction, heatmaps |
| 5 | Ad Platform APIs | Planned | Google Ads, Meta Marketing API, LinkedIn Campaign Manager — paid audience ring |

**9 AudienceIQ widgets** deployed to Insights dashboard:
1. ContributorFunnelWidget — clicks → signups → active → quality
2. QualityByChannelWidget — avg quality per utm_source
3. RetentionCurveWidget — retention over 30/60/90 days
4. SkillDistributionWidget — declared vs actual skills
5. TargetingVsRealityWidget — targeting config vs CRM reality
6. DriftRadarWidget — four-ring visualization with severity
7. AudienceHealthWidget — circular gauge (0-100) + issue list
8. Ga4TrafficWidget — sessions, sources, devices
9. GscQueriesWidget — top search queries + CTR/position

### Country Quotas & Demographics (NEW — April 23)
- **Spec complete**: Per-country volume, rates, demographic quotas in intake wizard
- **Data model**: `CountryQuota` + `DemographicQuota` types
- **Locale rate integration**: Feeds into ROAS framework (RPP per locale)
- **Persona scaling rule**: Dynamic persona/actor counts based on country count
- **Implementation**: Plan written, ready for execution

### Infrastructure & Security
- 17-commit security hardening (auth bypass, IDOR, XSS, secrets, CSP)
- GitHub Actions CI: build, lint, test, Python lint, Docker build
- Multi-arch Dockerfile (Azure VM + Apple Silicon)
- WordPress auto-publish with Yoast SEO
- UTM tracked link builder with click tracking
- Teams + Outlook webhook notifications

## What's Planned (Not Yet Shipped)

### Day 18: Server-Side GTM for Meta Conversions API (NEW)
Server-side Google Tag Manager container enables real conversion tracking via Meta Conversions API. Instead of relying on browser-side pixels (blocked by ad blockers, iOS privacy), server-side events send conversion data directly from the server. This captures:
- Signup completions (not just landing page visits)
- Profile completions (the actual conversion event)
- Quality contributor status (from CRM datalake feedback loop)

Feeds into AudienceIQ Ring 2 (Paid Audience) and enables true ROAS calculation.

### Day 18: CRM Datalake Integration (NEW)
Connect the CRM datalake (richer than transactional CRM) into AudienceIQ:
- Quality scores per contributor
- Task completion rates
- Retention metrics (30/60/90 day)
- Skill match accuracy
- Geographic distribution

Extends the existing `CRM_DATABASE_URL` pattern. Feeds Ring 4 (Converted Audience) with deeper quality signals for drift detection and health scoring.

### Day 19: ROAS Formula Unification (NEW)
Unify the revised ROAS and target CPA formulas from `/Users/stevenjunop/Oneformadata/roas_framework.md` into the Command Center + AudienceIQ:
- Per-country ROAS using locale rates from country_quotas
- Target CPA benchmarks per campaign type
- Breakeven CPA calculation with fulfillment rate adjustment
- RevBrain budget recommendations powered by real conversion data (from server-side GTM)

### Fixed: WordPress Taxonomy Posting (April 23)
WordPress auto-publish now correctly assigns custom post types, ACF fields, and taxonomy terms. Previously posts were going to wrong categories.

### Week 3-4: Azure Migration (4 days estimated)
Michael (China engineering lead) completed code review April 22. Proposed hybrid deployment:

| Component | Current | Target | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend (Next.js) | Vercel | Vercel (no change) | 0 min |
| Python Worker | Local MLX poller | Azure Container Apps | Add Dockerfile (~2 hours) |
| Database | Neon Postgres | Azure Postgres Flexible | pg_dump/restore + swap DATABASE_URL (~1 hour) |
| File Storage | Vercel Blob | Azure Blob | Swap blob.ts (~30 min) |
| Auth | Clerk | Clerk (no change) | 0 min |
| Domain | nova-intake.vercel.app | nova.oneforma.com | DNS CNAME (~15 min) |

**GPU infrastructure ask**: Steven asked Michael about company GPU access for self-hosted NIM models (Qwen 3.5 397B, Gemma 4 30B, MiniMax 2.7). If available, eliminates API rate limits and external dependencies. If not, continue with NIM key rotation (15 keys).

### Week 3-4: Command Center (SRC Port)
Port `/Users/stevenjunop/src-command` analytics dashboard:
- Campaign-scoped KPI cards (spend, applications, CPA, conversion rate, ROAS)
- Channel mix breakdowns per campaign
- RevBrain budget recommendations
- Export generation + shareable report links
- ROAS framework from `/Users/stevenjunop/Oneformadata/roas_framework.md`

ROAS formula (recruitment-specific):
```
RPP = Contract Value / Required Participants
Net RPP = RPP - Variable Cost Per Participant
CPA = Ad Spend / Completions
Effective CPA = Ad Spend / (Completions x Fulfillment Rate)
ROAS = (Completions x FR x Net RPP) / Ad Spend
Breakeven CPA = Net RPP x Fulfillment Rate
```

### Week 4: Stage 4 Template Polish
- Refine HTML creative templates for agency-quality output
- Fix remaining Stage 4 parsing issues (#4 country code mismatch, #5 budget strings, #6 double-encoded JSON)
- Add 10+ new template variations
- VQA quality gate tuning

### Week 4-5: Organic Content Extension
- Social posts (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter) — Stage 3 extension
- Flyers and posters — Stage 4 extension
- Email sequences — new generation flow
- Job posting copy — per-locale adaptation

### Week 5: SVP Pitch Preparation
- 3-5 real campaigns run end-to-end with results
- Time savings analysis (3-5 days → 30 minutes)
- Cost analysis (agency cost vs $0 NIM)
- Live demo of full pipeline + Command Center
- VYRA integration pitch deck
