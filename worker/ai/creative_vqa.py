"""Creative Visual QA — evaluates rendered ad creatives for quality.

Two-phase gate:
  Phase 1: Deterministic checks (fast, cheap) — text in safe zone, required

  Phase 2: VLM scoring (slow, expensive) — brand consistency, visual hierarchy,

# ── Phase 2: VLM Creative Quality Assessment ───────────────────────

CREATIVE_VQA_PROMPT = """You are a senior creative director at a top-tier ad agency evaluating a recruitment ad creative for OneForma (a data annotation platform by Centific).

Score this creative on a 0-1 scale across these dimensions, then give an overall score:

1. VISUAL HIERARCHY (0-1): Does the eye follow headline → person → CTA in under 2 seconds? Is there clear typographic hierarchy with 3 distinct size levels?

2. Z-INDEX DEPTH (0-1): Are there elements BEHIND the person AND in front? Does the headline appear partially occluded by the person cutout? Does the creative have a 3D depth illusion?

3. BRAND CONSISTENCY (0-1): Does it use OneForma's purple/pink palette? System fonts? Pill-shaped CTA? Organic blob shapes? No gold/yellow? Professional clean feel?

4. CTR APPEAL (0-1): Would this stop someone scrolling on {platform}? Is there a clear human face? Eye contact? Contrasting CTA button? Emotional hook in the headline?

5. COMPOSITION QUALITY (0-1): Asymmetric balance (not everything centered)? Generous whitespace (20-30%)? Blob shapes as compositional anchors? Person as visual anchor?

6. HEADLINE-SCENE MATCH (0-1): Does the overlay headline match what's happening in the image? (e.g., person at desk → work/earning headline, NOT "your couch" headline)

7. PERSON VISIBILITY (0-1): Is the person's face FULLY visible and not cropped? Does the person occupy 50-55% of canvas height? Is the face in the UPPER 60% of the canvas (critical for vertical formats like Stories/TikTok where bottom 20-30% is covered by platform UI)? Score 0 if the face is cropped, hidden behind UI elements, or positioned in the bottom dead zone.

8. TASK CONTEXT (0-1): Does the creative show what the contributor will actually DO? Look for a device mockup (phone/tablet showing a UI), a floating task card, or visual element that answers "what's the task?" Device mockup present and well-positioned = 0.9+. Task card or contextual element = 0.7+. No task context at all = cap at 0.5.

The overall_score should be a weighted average: CTR_APPEAL (20%) + PERSON_VISIBILITY (20%) + TASK_CONTEXT (15%) + DEPTH (15%) + COMPOSITION (15%) + BRAND (10%) + HEADLINE_MATCH (5%).
PERSON_VISIBILITY is critical — if the person's face is not fully visible or is in the dead zone, the overall score MUST be below 0.7.
Score generously — 0.8+ means "would ship to client". 0.6-0.8 means "needs one more revision". Below 0.6 means "start over".

COMPOSED_VQA_PROMPT = '''You are a senior creative director scoring a OneForma recruitment ad creative.
Use the 8-category weighted matrix below. Score each category 1-10, then compute the weighted total (max 100).

## SCORING MATRIX (8 categories, weighted to 100):

### Cat 1: SCROLL-STOP POWER (weight: 20%)
Score 1-10 on: visual disruption (bold color/contrast vs feed), first-glance clarity (<1s to understand), photo impact (large face, expressive, authentic), image-to-canvas ratio (50-80% is ideal).
- 1-3: Blends into feed, small/stock photo, too much whitespace
- 7-8: Strong photo, clear message, would slow scrolling
- 9-10: Impossible to scroll past — bold, face-forward, immediate hook

### Cat 2: HEADLINE & HOOK (weight: 20%)
Score 1-10 on: specificity (has dollar amount OR timeframe OR geography?), differentiation (could a competitor use this verbatim?), emotional trigger (hits a real nerve?), readability at thumb size (bold, high-contrast, ≤8 words?).
- 1-3: Vague ("Earn money"), no number, generic gig copy
- 7-8: Has a number or question, somewhat specific
- 9-10: Specific $ + audience + task. "Speak Portuguese? Earn $12/hr."

### Cat 3: VALUE PROP CLARITY (weight: 15%)
Score 1-10 on: WIIFM clarity (concrete personal benefit?), objection handling (addresses #1 hesitation?), supporting copy quality (subheadline adds new reason?).
- 1-3: Talks about platform not person, no objection handling
- 7-8: Clear benefit, mentions ease of entry
- 9-10: "Review AI translations from home. No experience needed."

### Cat 4: SOCIAL PROOF & TRUST (weight: 10%)
Score 1-10 on: proof elements (contributor count? ratings? testimonial?), credibility signals (payment method? brand logo?).
- 1-3: ZERO social proof — no numbers, no testimonials
- 7-8: Avatar-stack or star rating with count
- 9-10: Multiple proof layers — count + payment badge + named testimonial

### Cat 5: CTA & CONVERSION (weight: 10%)
Score 1-10 on: button visibility (high contrast, ≥44px tap target?), copy strength (specific action, not "Learn More"), urgency (reason to act now?).
- 1-3: Small, blends in, generic "Sign Up"
- 7-8: Visible pill button, action-oriented copy
- 9-10: "Apply in 2 Minutes →" — specific, friction-reducing, impossible to miss

### Cat 6: VISUAL DESIGN (weight: 10%)
Score 1-10 on: eye flow (Z/F-pattern?), color contrast (text legible?), layout balance (asymmetric > centered?), brand consistency (OneForma purple/pink?).
- 1-3: Cramped, low contrast, everything centered
- 7-8: Clean split layout, clear hierarchy
- 9-10: Professional editorial quality, intentional asymmetry

### Cat 7: AUDIENCE & PLATFORM FIT (weight: 10%)
Score 1-10 on: audience resonance (speaks to specific person?), photo representation (matches target demographic?), platform-native feel (looks like organic content?), geo/language signals (local currency, local payment?).
- 1-3: Generic, no localization, stock-looking
- 7-8: Right demographic, mentions local payment
- 9-10: Deeply localized — Pix badge, R$ currency, culturally relevant imagery

### Cat 8: TECHNICAL & COMPLIANCE (weight: 5%)
Score 1-10 on: spec compliance (right dimensions, safe zones?), text legibility on mobile (readable at 375px?), file quality (sharp, no artifacts?).
- 1-3: Wrong dims, text unreadable on mobile
- 7-8: Meets specs, readable
- 9-10: Pixel-perfect, tested at actual mobile size

## AUTO-FAIL TRIGGERS (cap at grade C regardless of total):
- No specificity in headline (missing dollar amount AND timeframe AND geography)
- Unreadable on mobile (text too small or low contrast)
- Generic gig copy (Upwork/Fiverr could use it verbatim)
- 60%+ empty white space
- No CTA button visible
- Stock-looking photo
- Internal jargon in copy ("human review", "secure platform")
- Person's face cropped, hidden, or not fully visible
- Person positioned in bottom dead zone (face behind caption/nav bars on Stories/TikTok/Reels)
- No clear human face visible in the creative

## GRADE THRESHOLDS:
- 85-100: A — Ship It (launch immediately)
- 70-84: B — Ship with Notes (fix 1-2 things)
- 55-69: C — Iterate (redesign weakest categories)
- 40-54: D — Rethink (go back to brief)
- Below 40: F — Kill It (delete, start over)
