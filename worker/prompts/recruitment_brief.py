- messaging_clarity: Are value props clear, concrete, and contributor-focused? Do they mention specific benefits (earnings, flexibility, skills)?
- channel_feasibility: Are recommended channels actually popular in the target regions?
- language_appropriateness: Is the content language correct for the target regions?

BRAND GUIDELINES:
- OneForma uses a LIGHT theme: white backgrounds, charcoal (#32373C) buttons and text.
- Buttons are pill-shaped (border-radius: 9999px).
- System fonts (-apple-system, system-ui, 'Segoe UI', Roboto).
- Accent: cyan-blue to purple gradient — used sparingly for highlights.
- Photography: real people in real settings, UGC aesthetic, NOT stock photos.
- The feel should be approachable, modern, clean — like a fintech app, not a job board.
