"""Marketing skills injector for pipeline stages.

Loads relevant marketing skill files and injects them into LLM prompts.
Skills sourced from: https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills

Each pipeline stage gets DIFFERENT skills injected:
- Stage 1 (Brief): marketing-psychology + copywriting + ad-creative
- Stage 3 (Copy): copywriting + ad-creative + paid-ads + social-content
- Stage 4 (Creative): ad-creative + copywriting
- Stage 5 (Video): marketing-psychology + copywriting + social-content
