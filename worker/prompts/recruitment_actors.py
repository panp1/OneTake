# Anti-gloss prompt addition — appended to every Seedream prompt
ANTI_GLOSS_INSTRUCTION = """
ANTI-AI-GLOSS — SUBJECT (the person MUST NOT look AI-generated):
- NO smooth plastic skin. Visible pores, micro-bumps, T-zone oiliness, under-eye texture.
- NO perfect hair. Flyaways, baby hairs, natural frizz, texture visible.
- NO pristine clothing. Wrinkles at elbows/waist, fabric weave visible, slight wear/pilling.
- NO uniform lighting on face. Mixed warm/cool sources = slight shadows under chin, nose shadow.
- NO oversaturation. Slightly muted like real iPhone — not AI-vibrant.
- Film grain from camera sensor. Not clean digital — slight noise especially in shadows.

ANTI-AI-GLOSS — BACKGROUND & ENVIRONMENT (just as important as the person):
- WALLS: Must have texture — paint brush strokes, slight scuff marks, nail holes, light switch plates, power outlets visible. NOT smooth gradients. Real walls have imperfections.
- FURNITURE: Visible wood grain on tables/desks, slight scratches, ring marks from cups, wear on chair edges. NOT pristine showroom furniture.
- FLOORS: Visible tile grout, carpet texture/flattening, slight dust in corners, scuff marks. NOT perfectly clean.
- SURFACES: Real items have shadows and dust. Laptop has fingerprints on screen edge. Phone has a case with slight wear. Coffee cup has a drip stain.
- LIGHTING ON ENVIRONMENT: Different color temperature on different surfaces — warm lamp on desk, cool daylight on wall near window. Hard shadows from objects (not soft AI ambient).
- WINDOW: If visible, slight overexposure (blown highlights), curtain/blind with uneven folds, real view outside (not AI-gradient sky).
- CLUTTER: Real spaces have clutter — visible wires, a charger cable, a water bottle, sticky notes, an open notebook, crumbs, a pen. NOT minimalist showroom.
- DEPTH: Background objects should be at different distances — some sharp, some blurred. Not everything at the same focal plane.
- Slight lens vignette at corners (real lenses darken at edges).

SCENE GENERATION RULES:
- Generate EXACTLY 4 scenes. Each scene key must be a unique snake_case identifier.
- Scenes must be SPECIFIC to this persona's real life — not generic stock photo scenarios.
- Consider: Where does a {persona} in {region} actually work? Relax? Celebrate? Commute?
- Demographics matter: A 20-year-old student's scenes differ from a 35-year-old parent's scenes.
- Income matters: Don't put a student in a luxury home office. Don't put a professional in a dorm room.
- Culture matters: A cafe in Marrakech looks different from a cafe in Seattle or Seoul.
- Task type matters: If the task is voice recording, show them speaking/recording. If it's data annotation, show them typing/scrolling. If it's an onsite study, show them commuting/arriving.
- One scene MUST show a "reward moment" — checking phone for payment, telling someone about earnings, treating themselves.
- One scene MUST show the actual task being performed — this is the "this is what the work looks like" image.
- Scene names should be human-readable and evocative, NOT generic (e.g., "Kitchen table before class" not "at_home_working").

RULES:
- Face lock = the person's PERMANENT features. Same in every image.
- Prompt seed = the dense text that Seedream uses for EVERY generation. It's the identity.
- Scenes = 4 DYNAMIC scenarios based on persona demographics, lifestyle, region, and task type.
- Signature accessory = appears in EVERY image (creates recognition across ad set).
- Backdrops = 4 realistic settings from {region} (NOT generic Western settings).
- Age 18-35 (the OneForma contributor demographic).
- NO stock-photo vibes. NO corporate attire. NO model-like appearance.
- They should look like a real {language}-speaking person in {region} who does gig work from home."""

- Eyes are unnaturally large, perfectly round, or have anime-style shine
- Skin looks painted, airbrushed to perfection, or has visible brush strokes
- Hair looks like drawn/painted strands rather than real hair texture
- Overall image has a "rendered" or "illustrated" quality rather than photographic
- Image looks like it came from Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion in illustration mode
If the image fails ANY of the above, score 0.0 for ALL dimensions and set passed=false.

Check EACH of these and score 0.0-1.0:

1. IDENTITY CONSISTENCY: Does the person match the face_lock description above?
   - Check: skin tone matches hex, eye color matches, hair matches, jawline matches
   - Check: distinguishing marks present (stubble, beauty mark, glasses, etc.)
   - Check: age looks correct for the specified range
   - Red flags: wrong skin tone, different hair, missing distinguishing features
   - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DIMENSION — the actor must be recognizable across all images

2. REALISM: Does this look like a real iPhone photo, not AI-generated or stock?
   - Check for: natural skin pores, realistic lighting imperfections, candid pose
   - Check for: fabric texture/wrinkles, environmental noise (real objects)
   - Red flags: plastic skin, perfect symmetry, uncanny valley, studio lighting, extra fingers
   - AUTO-REJECT (score 0.0): hex codes visible on screens (#XXXXXX), gibberish/debug text on devices,
     fake money/currency rendered on screens, fake app UIs with placeholder data,
     any text that looks like code or technical output visible in the scene
   - AUTO-REJECT (score 0.0): cartoon/illustration/anime/digital painting appearance (see REALISM CHECK above)

3. CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY: Does this person look like they belong in {region}?
   - Check for: appropriate ethnicity, realistic clothing for the region, authentic setting
   - Red flags: generic/ambiguous ethnicity, Western-default clothing, mismatched setting

4. ACCESSORY CHECK: Is the signature accessory ({accessory}) visible in the image?
   - Must be clearly present — this creates recognition across the ad campaign
   - Red flag: accessory missing or wrong item shown

5. BRAND FIT: Would this work for a OneForma contributor recruitment ad?
   - Check for: approachable, relatable, working-from-home/cafe vibe
   - Red flags: corporate attire, model-like appearance, luxury setting
   - AUTO-REJECT (score 0.0): swimming pool in background, mansion/luxury interior,
     dirty/messy/dilapidated room (poverty stereotype), cracked walls, trash visible,
     environment that doesn't match a middle-class {region} home or cafe

6. TECHNICAL QUALITY: Is the image usable for an ad?
   - Check for: proper framing, no artifacts, face clearly visible, good resolution
   - Red flags: distorted features, extra fingers, blurry face, watermarks
