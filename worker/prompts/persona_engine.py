"""Persona Engine — generates target contributor personas from task requirements.

Once we know the job type, required skills, target regions, and languages,
we generate 3 distinct personas representing the types of people most
likely to sign up. These personas then FEED:
- Actor identity cards (each actor embodies a persona)
- Creative briefs (messaging tailored to persona pain points)
- Ad copy (different hooks per persona)
- Channel strategy (where each persona spends time)
- Psychology hooks (which biases to leverage per persona)

Inspired by the customer-research and product-marketing-context skills
from the marketingskills framework.

    This is a convenience wrapper that delegates to
    ``cultural_research.apply_research_to_personas``. It exists here so
    callers working with the persona engine don't need to import a
    separate module.

    Adjustments:
    - If AI fatigue is HIGH: remove "AI" from messaging, reframe as
      "flexible remote work".
    - If gig work is STIGMATIZED: frame as "professional freelance" not
      "gig work".
    - If trust is LOW: add trust signals (company size, known clients,
      payment proof).
    - If platform reality differs from defaults: override best_channels.
    - If economic context shows low wages: adjust rate framing.
    - Add cultural sensitivity notes to each persona.
    - Add language nuance to copy guidance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    personas:
        List of persona dicts from ``generate_personas``.
    research:

Generate 3 DISTINCT target personas for a specific recruitment campaign.

Each persona must be a REAL person profile — not a generic archetype.
Base your personas on the cultural research data and job description provided.

For each persona, output:
- archetype_key: a snake_case key (e.g., "seattle_tech_worker", "diverse_local_resident")
- archetype: human-readable title (e.g., "Seattle Tech Professional")
- persona_name: a realistic first name appropriate for the region
- age: specific age (not range)
- age_range: range like "25-35"
- region: which target region this persona is from
- language: primary language
- lifestyle: 1-2 sentence description of their daily life
- motivations: list of 3 specific reasons they'd sign up for THIS project
- pain_points: list of 3 specific barriers or concerns they'd have about THIS project
- objections: list of 3 things they'd say to push back ("Is this legit?", etc.)
- digital_habitat: list of 5 platforms where they spend time (be specific to the region)
- best_channels: list of 3 ad platforms to reach them
- psychology_profile: {
    primary_bias: which cognitive bias to leverage (e.g., "social_proof", "loss_aversion"),
    secondary_bias: second bias,
    messaging_angle: the core message that would resonate,
    trigger_words: list of 4-5 words/phrases that would catch their attention

- jobs_to_be_done: list of 3 "jobs" this person is trying to accomplish by signing up

    },
    interests: {
      hyper: list of 3+ VERY specific interests related to the task (e.g., "AI data labeling", "voice recording freelance", "linguistic research" — NOT generic like "technology"),
      hot: list of 2-3 stacked interests (e.g., "side hustle" + "flexible work schedule"),
      broad: list of 3-5 wider interests to cover the full target base (e.g., "part time jobs", "online earning", "university life")
    },

      values: list of 3 core values,
      pain_points: same as persona pain_points (reference),

    budget_weight_pct: integer 1-100 — what % of budget this persona should get (all personas must sum to 100)
  }

CRITICAL:
- Personas must be DIFFERENT from each other (different demographics, different motivations)
- Personas must be SPECIFIC to the project location, compensation, and requirements
- Use the cultural research to inform platform choices and messaging
- Think about WHO would actually show up for this — not who you wish would show up
- targeting_profile.interests.hyper MUST be specific to the task type. For audio recording → "voice acting", "podcast production", "audiobook narration". For data annotation → "AI training data", "data labeling", "machine learning datasets". NEVER generic like "technology" or "AI".
- budget_weight_pct across all personas MUST sum to exactly 100
- estimated_pool_size should reflect actual market size in the target region based on cultural research

OUTPUT: Return a JSON array of 3 persona objects. No markdown, no commentary.
