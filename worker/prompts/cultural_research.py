"""Cultural Research Engine — deep research via Kimi K2.5 before persona generation.

Uses Kimi K2.5's web-grounded search to research REAL cultural intelligence
for each target region. This data enriches persona generation with:
- AI fatigue levels (are people tired of "AI job" ads?)
- Gig work perception (stigma? aspiration? necessity?)
- Trust in data annotation (scam associations?)
- Platform usage (what apps do people ACTUALLY use?)
- Economic context (competitive hourly rates, unemployment)
- Cultural considerations (religious, social, gender norms)
- Tech literacy (smartphone penetration, internet quality)
- Language nuances (formal vs informal, dialect preferences)

This research happens ONCE per campaign in Stage 1, then feeds into
persona generation, actor creation, copy writing, and channel selection.
