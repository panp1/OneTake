"""Marketing Brief Evaluator — brand voice auditor for OneForma briefs.

Every brief must demonstrate:
1. Direct traceability to the RFP requirements
2. Persona-specific messaging (not generic)
3. Cultural intelligence integration
4. OneForma BRAND VOICE compliance (tagline, 4 tone rules, no banned words)
5. Ethical positioning for sensitive topics
6. Actionable channel strategy with evidence
7. Pillar clarity (Earn / Grow / Shape angles surfaced for downstream copy)

Scoring: 0-10 per dimension (Neurogen pattern)
Hard gates: MIN_ACCEPT = 8.0 overall, MIN_DIM = 7 per dimension
Verdict: accept | revise | reject

Brand voice auditor: any brief containing a word from WORDS_TO_AVOID receives
an automatic 0 on brand_voice_compliance, which triggers a hard-gate failure.

=== HARD GATES ===
- Overall weighted score must be >= {MIN_ACCEPT_SCORE} to accept
- Every dimension must score >= its min_score (see above)
- If a sensitive topic is detected, ethical_compliance < 7 = REJECT (not just revise)
- BRAND VOICE GATE: If ANY of these banned words appears anywhere in the brief
  output, brand_voice_compliance is AUTOMATICALLY 0 and the verdict is REJECT.
  Banned words: {banned_words_csv}

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Score each dimension 0-10 using the scoring guide above.
2. Provide specific feedback per dimension (what worked, what failed, what to fix).
3. List concrete improvement suggestions if verdict is not "accept".
4. For rfp_traceability: check that each value prop maps to a specific RFP requirement, framed expertise-first.
5. For persona_specificity: check that personas are positioned as experts (linguistic, professional, lived, or cultural).
6. For cultural_integration: check for real cultural data, not generic regional references.
7. For brand_voice_compliance: scan the entire brief for banned words first. If found, score = 0. Otherwise, audit tagline alignment, the 4 tone rules (Expertise First, Human First, Purposeful, Specific), and locked CTA usage.
8. For pillar_clarity: check that the brief clearly identifies Earn / Grow / Shape angles a downstream copywriter could pick from.
9. For ethical_compliance: if sensitive topics exist, check positive framing and avoid-phrases.
