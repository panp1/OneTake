"""Video script generator — hook->problem->solution->value_prop->CTA.

Each script follows the attention-first format for short-form video:
- Hook (0-3s): Stop-scroll opener, face-to-camera or bold statement
- Problem (3-6s): Relatable pain point for the target persona
- Solution (6-10s): How OneForma solves it
- Value Prop (10-13s): Key differentiator
- CTA (13-15s): Clear action with urgency

Scripts are persona-driven — each persona gets a different script
with different hooks, pain points, and psychology.
